# swbf-hax
very bored, made an internal cheat for swbf classic (2004). 
worth noting that it only seems to work in windowed mode.
- hooks d3d9 to draw imgui menus
- hooks direct input 8 for mouse input

features:
- health lock
- infinite ammo
- instant win
- change weapon ordnance type
- very basic esp. less buggy now (?)
